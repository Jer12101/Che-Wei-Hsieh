# 👋 Hi, I'm Che-Wei Hsieh

I'm a Master's student in Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania, with a prior background in Chemical Engineering. I'm passionate about applying software to solve real-world engineering problems — from process modeling to system simulation and intelligent automation.

## 🔬 Recent Projects

### 🧠 Neuromorphic Simulation (Research @ NTU)
> Simulated a custom transistor array for MNIST pattern recognition using TensorFlow. Explored biologically-inspired update rules and hardware-constrained learning dynamics. (*Code unavailable as the thesis is still under embargo*)

### 💬 Full-Stack Messaging App
> A web-based messaging platform built during my internship to learn modern frameworks: React, NestJS, MySQL, RabbitMQ. Features real-time message handling and user role management. The code repository related to the project are "react_frontend_to_nest_rest_API" and "webapp_practice" 

### 🕉️ CBETA Discord Bot
> A lightweight Discord bot passion project for friends that delivers random excerpts from the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA) database. Built with Node.js and Discord.js.
